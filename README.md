# Diabetes Detection
The prevalence of diabetes has been steadily increasing globally, leading to significant health, economic, and societal impacts. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. However, traditional screening methods are often insufficient or impractical. Therefore, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using easily obtainable clinical parameters, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. By leveraging labeled data and advanced algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, and neural networks, the model strives to achieve high accuracy and generalizability. Ultimately, the goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable and accessible tool for early identification and intervention in individuals at risk of developing diabetes. This model has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and contribute to preventive measures in the fight against diabetes. Furthermore, the project emphasizes transparency and reproducibility by offering clean Python code, comprehensive documentation, data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering methods, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. It also welcomes contributions and collaborations, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
