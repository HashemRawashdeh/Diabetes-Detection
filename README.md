# Diabetes Detection
 This Github repository contains the code for a machine learning project that focuses on diabetes detection. The project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on a set of input features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. It utilizes a dataset of labeled diabetes cases and employs various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, and neural networks. The repository provides clean and well-commented Python code along with comprehensive documentation, enabling easy understanding and reproducibility of the results. The project also includes data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, model evaluation metrics, and visualizations for insights.
